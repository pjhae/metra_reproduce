# METRA Model Reproduction

This repository contains a from-scratch reproduction of the [METRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08887) algorithm. The code aims to replicate the results presented in the original paper within the Ant-v3 environment.

## Algorithm Schematic

The following image provides a visual representation of the METRA algorithm's structure:
